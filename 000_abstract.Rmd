This exploratory desk study evaluates the upstream fish passability of the tidal weir-lock complex on the Dender river in Dendermonde under its current management.
Free fish migration is essential for both diadromous (migration between sea and freshwater) and potamodromous (migration within freshwater) fish species, but is often obstructed by structures in Flemish waterways.
The tidal weir in Dendermonde, which is part of the Sigma Plan, constitutes a potential migration bottleneck between the Sea Scheldt and the Dender.

**Key Findings on Fish Passage**

Under the current circumstances, upstream fish movement is possible, albeit for a limited portion of the time.
The chance of successful migration varies greatly depending on the route and the flow conditions:

**Fish passage under the weir is more favorable than over the weir.**

-   Fish were able to pass upstream under the weir for **8.6% of the time** during the study period.

-   When water flows under the weir (restricted flow), passage is possible in **30.9%** of that time.

-   Under 'free flowing' conditions (lower gate fully open), the weir is passable for **76.3%** of the time.

-   Under restricted flow, upstream movement under the weir is only possible if the upstream water level is **14 cm or less** above the downstream level.

**Fish passage over the weir is more restricted:**

-   Fish were able to pass upstream over the weir for **7.0% of the time** during the study period.

-   When water flows over the weir (restricted flow), passage is possible in only **11.3%** of that time.

-   Fish movement over the weir is primarily possible during **ebb tide** when the water can flow over the weir in an upstream direction.

The study period showed that downstream migration possibilities are significantly higher every day than upstream migration possibilities.
The weir is regulated with the upper plate for most of the time (62.0%), causing water to primarily flow **over** the weir.
In periods of increased discharge, the lower weir plate is used (26.8% of the time), causing water to primarily flow **under** the weir.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

To improve fish passage, it is preferred to apply weir management that approaches the natural **free flowing conditions** as much as possible.

**Preferred Management:** It is recommended to use the **lower gate** to regulate the weir, where possible.
Fish passage over the weir is strongly limited when regulated with the upper gate.
**Recommended operational measure:**

-   Raising the **lower gate** to create an opening of at least **30 cm** between the bed and the top of the lower gate.

-   Doing this when the upstream level is **less than 14 cm** higher than the downstream level.

The study assumed a uniform flow velocity distribution, which is a simplification of reality.

**Future Research**

To arrive at clearly defined management proposals, a combination of a **telemetry study** (to map the importance of migration) and a more **in-depth hydraulic model study** (to evaluate the effectiveness of adjusted management) is recommended.
